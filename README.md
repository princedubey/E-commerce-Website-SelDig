# Ecommerce website with vue js and firebase

## Preface
This is my first web project which is an online store. I created the site with vuejs and firebase. In addition, the project is a practical application to the training I followed on the "Vue school" site.

<h4> Why i chose vuejs framework? </h4>

Only. vuejs has a big community, especially vuejs and laravel. Vue js is widely used all over the world. Do you know that Nentendre wibsite, Gitlab, Laracast, Laravel Vapor and other well-known sites are developed with vuejs.

This is definitely the framework I recommend for frontend development.
